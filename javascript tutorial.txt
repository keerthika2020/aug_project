redeclaration is not posibble but updation is possible
const  will not allow same variable names for two values 
redeclaration and updation is not posibble

es6 filter in javascript
filter()= only works with array for iteration 
filters based on cond
map() // using map we can iterate each element and do manipulations on them
goes through each and every element and do changes to the element
both filter and map will create new array without modifying source array
# chainning methods
to filter even no and then multiply them by 2 
perform server api integration in js
using fetch method and then given 
javascript promise: fn has to return something ie either success or failure instead of just execution
we dont know when it'll return  promise will wait untill it gets a response 
by default get method is taken if we didn't use fetch 
whenever we use await we use async
status code in api in javascript 
100-199 information response
200-299 successful responses
300-399 redirection  messages
400-499 server is fine but client side error occures
500-599 internal server has some errors issues but your data is correct
http :
to integrate an api in http
server team has to confirm this three 
api url 
the http method
what type of data is shared 
JSON.stringify to convert json file to json string
when we use post method it is mandatory to tell the server that what type of data we are passing
to the server by using http headers .

day 6 20/8/24
server has our data so we need api to get the data
rest api that gets data from the server and gives back to the client 
server url , http method , data we pass --------> 3 main things
every server has a unique domain name to reach the server we must give the domain name.
api can be triggered from the applications that are connect to the internet
just by calling the fn we can not get the result since it takes some time so we use promise 
thread parallely running process in javascript we have promise simillar to thread
promises will wait till the action is completed when we don't know how much time our task gets complete
fetch method is buit based on the promise concept---> if the server takes 1 min to reply it'll wait for 1 min
await is a keyword that will halt/pause our code to get executed
http method:
get 
post
put
delete
patch 
get => going to get the data from the server
what data ur passing in the get method , will be visible in the url ie the data always be public  
 it is limited ie we can only send limited character to get method
post=> send the data to the server
the data is not visible ,  there is no limitaiton 
this is why we sent username and password in post method coz of sensitive info in pass is protected by post
file upload is done with post method coz of file size limations in get method
but using get we can send string 
by default the browser points to get only

Day 7  21/08/24
objct array have key and value pairs
key must be unique  and value can be duplicate
object into the index array or vice versa
json['data']  = > the reqres server has stored that data

These below storages are in client side 
we can see these two storage in our google browser inspect> application> storage
local storage and sessoion storage both have data stored in the web browser
ls data is permanent in user system unless they uninstall or delete the data
 google mail is automatically loged in coz token is created when we log for first time and stored in local 
if log in again it checks the token and logs in automatically
ss data is deleted whenever the user closes the browser or a tab
for secured based applications 
net banking websites use ss coz log in netbanking the session is closed when we come out of the website
cookie 
u search in amazon but google will give you ads related to the search
how it know its you and how it give you the ads when u search amazon
answer is the cookies.... but how????
when we access google and go to incognito 
it creates a unique no for you device
what search is done it's unique id is stored in the google browser and according to the id it shows the ads to u
actual value will be availabel in the db which is corresponding to the cookie id 
why use cookie instead of local storage?
the data in cookie is directly accessible form the server
but if we use local storage the data can only be stored using javascript

React js
node package manager = > open source , can be contributed by anyone , can install necessary libraries for our node projects 
1)	set up a react project:
new version
npx create-react-app appname
always tries to connect to the internet to downloads and sets up a project everytime
old version
npm create-react-app appname
install the lib and further no need to connect to the internet 
2) cd myapp
3) npm start
4) public is accessible to all , src work on it  ,
 .gitignore files we dont want to track in github 
package.json what lib we mentioned in project only name and version number 0.1.0 => production.build.localbuild (stage of developement)
standard of coding  => eslist config  readme is the description of our project.
packge.lock.jason contains details of where to download the lib form where
5) micro frontend ??
DATE 8 22/08/24
class name and component name must be same as the file name
we have to give npm start everytime to run our react app
myapp>src>rightclick>newfile>Home.js create
this file can't be used for another file if we did not export 
export is a javascript keyword that will export so that our fn/ var can be used outside the Home.js
now if we use  <Home/> in our App.js it will print the Home component h1 in website
{} data binding
normal react cant use let anbd var since it is not updateable to avoid this react came up with a soltion
state variable. => whenever we update the var the react will refresh updation automatically
This should be written in fn :

const [varname , setVar]= useState('your varname value');
{varname}
<p><input type='text' placeholder='email' onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}/><br></br><br></br>
      <input type='text' placeholder='mobile' onChange={(e) => setMobile(e.target.value)}/><br></br><br></br>
      <button>Click</button></p>
the( e ) is current element or event element
getter , setters:
 create a validation like text box is empty throw warning
add html into js so priority goes to js inside the main fn define another fn validate the newly added fn should be above the return 
const valid =()=> {
    
  }

task 
create new app
new component =>  Login.js
email pass on button click if empty alert mesg show

Day 9: 27.08.24
in react to display in the webpage
use state variable to print the value in the screen see for taskapp src register.js
Day 10 28.08.2024
create a new app reduxapp npx create-react-app reduxapp
create 3 pages home about contanct.js files in  src
and do the routing  npm i react-router-dom
set up the router:
since localhost:3000 has an empty end point so it gives an 404 error as we have configured for home , about , contact url 
so we must inclulde any url like
http://localhost:3000/About to display the about  page
import './App.css';
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

let routerPaths = createBrowserRouter([
{ path: "/", element: <Home /> },
  { path: "/home", element: <Home /> },
  { path: "/about", element: <About /> },
  { path: "/contact", element: <Contact /> },
]);

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <RouterProvider router={routerPaths} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

to overcome this issue we use { path: "/", element: <Home /> }, inside the router var so that by default it opens to home page
note :
whenever we do render any page in another page like
<Header></Header> 	give import statement
import Header from "./Header";
common state/store management : it is a common storage to share the variable of one page to another page to share data across the components
we use redux to implement this concept
context default lib comming from react this will also solve the problem but it comes from react 
to do this we need to install the redux library  into our application:    npm install react-redux 
the next one library to install is :     npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
configuration : In src create a folder called redux inside it create a file called Config.js
our entier app will be the children for the redux
the configureStore is the common storage for our app.
import { myStore } from './redux/Config';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';

 <Provider store = {myStore}>  
      <div className="App">
    <RouterProvider router={routerPaths} />
  </div>  
   </Provider>
configureStore creates a store and  inside that store we store out variable
reducers are the logic we built
// state is the initial state ie my value will be this when my page is loaded
//action whethere we are performing addition or subraction or any other operation ie this action is from 
+ or  - button 

import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

const counterLogic = (state = 0, action) => {

}

export const myStore = configureStore({
    reducer:{
        "counter":counterLogic, //here counter is the store name
    }
})
